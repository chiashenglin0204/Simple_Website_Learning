      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Yang Mi was born in Xuanwu District, Beijing to a police officer and a
        housewife. She was given the name "幂" (exponentiation) because her
        parents both have the same surname Yang. She graduated from the
        now-defunct Beijing Xuanwu Experimental Primary School. Yang is also a
        graduate of Beijing Film Academy's Performance Institute.
