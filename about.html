      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Yang Mi was born in Xuanwu District, Beijing to a police officer and a
        housewife. She was given the name "幂" (exponentiation) because her
        parents both have the same surname Yang. She graduated from the
        now-defunct Beijing Xuanwu Experimental Primary School. Yang is also a
        graduate of Beijing Film Academy's Performance Institute.

      <h2>Personal life and Politics</h2>
      <p>
        In early 2012, Yang Mi revealed her relationship with an Hong Kong
        actor-singer Hawick Lau through her Weibo. In November 2013, she
        announced their engagement. Yang Mi and Hawick Lau were married in Bali,
        Indonesia on 8 January 2014.[64] On 1 June 2014, she gave birth to their
        daughter Noemie Lau at the Hong Kong Adventist Hospital, Hong Kong.[65]
        On 22 December 2018, Yang Mi and Hawick Lau announced their divorce in a
        joint-statement released by Chinese entertainment and media company
        Jiaxing Media.[66] On 25 March 2021, Yang Mi cut ties with Adidas, after
        several companies including the brand announced its decision to not use
        cotton sourced from the Xinjiang region due to concerns of Uyghur forced
        labour. This action was echoed by most other Chinese celebrities.[67] As
        of June 2021, Yang Mi has more than 110 million followers on Weibo,
        making her one of the most widely followed celebrities on the Chinese
        microblogging platform.
